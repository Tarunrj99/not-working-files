    <p>Hello,</p>

    <p>I hope you're doing well. I’m reaching out to explore if there are any QA Engineer openings at your organization.
    </p>
    <p>With<strong> 2.6 years of experience in Quality Assurance,</strong> I specialize in<strong> manual testing, API testing (Postman), and test automation using Selenium with Java</strong>. I’ve worked extensively in Agile environments, contributing to high-quality product releases by designing and executing test cases, building automation frameworks (TestNG, Maven), and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams.

        I also have experience using tools like<strong> JIRA, Katalon Studio</strong>, and am well-versed in functional, regression, and smoke testing across web and mobile platforms.
        
        If your team is hiring or expects to be soon, I’d appreciate the opportunity to connect or learn more.
